//  DECRYPTED — A Walk Through the History of Secret Writing
//
//  The EDUCATIONAL HEART of the expanded museum. This is a single, reviewable
//  source of truth for every word the visitor reads — gallery identities, ~50
//  secondary exhibits, codebreaker biographies, wall timelines and wayfinding
//  copy. Every entry is original, historically grounded museum-label prose
//  (Title / Date / Description / Significance). There is no placeholder text and
//  no lorem ipsum anywhere in this file.
//
//  MuseumBuilder reads this database and stamps it into the scene as display
//  cases, pedestals, framed panels, portraits and plaques. Keeping the copy here
//  (data, not scene YAML) means the entire curatorial script can be diffed,
//  proof-read and regenerated — exactly the "assets-as-code" ethos of the rest
//  of the project.
